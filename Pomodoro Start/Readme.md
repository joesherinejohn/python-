The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks


The original technique has six steps:

Decide on the task to be done.
Set the Pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).
Work on the task.
End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5â€“10 minutes).
Go back to Step 2 and repeat until you complete four pomodoros.
After four pomodoros are done, take a long break (typically 20 to 30 minutes) instead of a short break. 
Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.

in this created this pomodoro timer.
